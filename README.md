# Patavino webapp
This is a scrappy version of a webapp for the Patavino platform. The project consist in a private platform where club members and fund operative team, can access to resources, accessible with credentials.

For the moment, the app contains home, login and dashboard pages and can be tested with the following credentials:
- user *member*:
    - username: `pippo`
    - password: `1234`
- user *operative*:
  - username: `pluto`
  - password: `1234`


#### TODO
- [ ] add a register page
- [ ] add a password recovery page
- [ ] encrypt passwords
- [ ] new graphic interface
